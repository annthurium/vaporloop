    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>

    <p>
      People say vinyl records sound warmer. I wonder if the same is true for
      analog telephones. I used to be so excited to talk on the phone for hours,
      as a teenager. Stretching the curly cord as far as it could go, to grant
      the illusion of diving into my own private world. These days, I’m a little
      more hesitant when the phone rings.

    <p>Don’t be wary. Take my hand. The waves are warmer than they look.</p>
