      LP mastering engineers as people who literally transform sound into
      physical waveforms; these engineers are sculptors of sound. The
      temperature, humidity, the quality of the blank lacquer discs, and the
      cutting stylus all potentially affect the sound of the finished product,
      the LP.

      People say vinyl records sound warmer. I wonder if the same is true for
      analog telephones. I used to be so excited to talk on the phone for hours,
      as a teenager. Stretching the curly cord as far as it could go, to grant
      the illusion of diving into my own private world. These days, I’m a little
      more hesitant when the phone rings.

    <p>Don’t be wary. Take my hand. The waves are warmer than they look.</p>
