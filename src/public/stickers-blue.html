  <h1>Dinousaur Stickers</h1>
  <p>
    They say that reptiles are cold-blooded and have no feelings. On the
    contrary, all dinosaurs know the frosty sting of sadness and the tingling
    rapture of joy. Some of them have feathers; at sunset, they fly above the
    crystalline lakes, chasing reflections of purple light on the water.
  </p>

  <p>Is it themselves they see, or the sun?</p>

  <p>
    You can‚Äôt stop here, this is dinosaur country. You can‚Äôt start here, this
    is dinosaur country. Pass through and leave the place brighter than you
    found it.

    Anthropology is the study of people, especially people to whom dinosaurs
    bring joy.

    In your hand, you have stickers with pictures of dinosaurs. Bring joy to
    your surroundings by attaching these stickers to items in the area around
    you. Feel free to wander and explore. We recommend bike racks, parking
    meters, stop lights and phone poles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although the stickers do come off easily, please do not be a dick. In
    particular, never put stickers on anyone‚Äôs personal stuff without their
    consent.

  <p>Paleontology is the study of what others have left behind. It is time to seek and give credit to others.</p>

  </p>Your dinosaur is either <b>blue</b> or <b>pink</b>. Find at least 3 stickers of the <em>other</em> color of
  dinosaur. (That is, if your
  dinosaur is blue, find 3 pink stickers, if your dinosaur is pink, find 3 blue stickers.) If you are the first team in
  this area, you may be unable to do this, in which case improvise.</p>

  <p><b>Send photos of the dinosaurs that you find to group chat.</b> Elaborate on that illustration -- how did the
    dinosaur get
    here? What were they doing when you caught them in action? Were they having fun?</p>

  <p>We are all in this together, even the pterodactyls.</p>

      If you stop here, you would just drop out into pre-history; merciless before the coming meteor. The Jurassic ended
      in
      fire. It is not yet your time to burn.

      Keep going through the loop; you will find somewhere worth …õ÷Ü∆à«ü÷Ñ…®’º…¢ to.
