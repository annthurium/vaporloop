    <h1>Semaphore</h1>
    <p>
      They say that there are ocean people, and mountain people. Extroverts love
      the open air, and introverts love protection of the earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      I disagree. Nobody can startle you on the water. You can be in company,
      and yet, entirely alone, signaling to others from miles away. The ocean is
      an indifferent sanctuary and a lonely kind of freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this station, you will use
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore">Flag Semaphore</a>
      to communicate with the other team, which is located down the street from
      you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flag semaphore uses flags and body positions to communicate letters (and
      numbers). Flags and a physical copy of the Semaphore Alphabet are
      provided.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are three parts to this, from easiest to hardest. Proceed to the
      next one when you are ready.
    </p>

    <h1>∆á«ü ü…®…Æ Ä«ü»∂…®’º…¢</h1>

    <p>
      You will use the provided semaphore to transmit one of the following words
      to each other and wait for the other team to do the same.
    </p>
    <!-- i should have used flexbox for this but I'm running behind on time at this point -->
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>BIKE</td>
        <td>HILL</td>
        <td>MEOW</td>
      </tr>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Start your transmission with [ATTENTION].</p>
    <p>If you see the other side signal [ATTENTION], put down your flags in the position of [REST/LISTENING].</p>
    <p>When you are finished with your transmission, put down your flags in the position of [REST/LISTENING].</p>
    <p>If you think that the other side should try again, respond with [CANCEL] for ‚ÄúNo idea!‚Äù.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, respond with [NUMERALS] for ‚ÄúI got it‚Äù, then perform a 15 second interpretive dance of the word that you have
    received.</p>
    <p>If the dance matches the word that you sent, respond with [NUMERALS] for ‚ÄúYou got it‚Äù.</p>

    <h1>‚Çµ√ò‚Ç•‚Ç•…Ñ‚Ç¶≈Ç‚Çµ‚Ç≥‚ÇÆ≈Ç‚Ç¶‚Ç≤</h1>
    <p>After the first words have been exchanged, feel free to transmit any words of your choosing. Please keep words under 6
    letters or less.</p>
    <p>The other rules, including the interpretive dance, remain the same.</p>
    <p>If you would like, you can send the word ‚ÄúPUZZLE‚Äù to go on to the next section.</p>
    </p>If the other team sends the word ‚ÄúPUZZLE‚Äù and you do not want to do puzzles, respond with the word ‚ÄúNO‚Äù followed by
    [CANCEL] . Otherwise respond with [NUMERALS] for ‚ÄúYou got it.‚Äù</p>
    <h1>ÍÄØÍÇ¶ÍííÍííÍÅ≤Íã∞ÍÇ¶ÍåÖÍÅ≤ÍãñÍÇëÍãäÍÅÖ</h1>

    <p>If you both want, you can solve the following puzzles together.</p>
    <p>Start with the Puzzle labeled ‚Äú1‚Äù then proceed to puzzle ‚Äú2‚Äù and so on.</p>
    <p>Each puzzle is a picture of ASCII art, broken up into two pieces, pink and blue. One team has the ‚Äúpink‚Äù sheet and the
    other team has the ‚Äúblue‚Äù sheet.</p>
    <p>Some cells on each sheet have been intentionally left blank. The other team knows what is in those cells, but you have
    to ask.</p>
    <p>To request the value at a given cell, show [ATTENTION]. When you get a [REST/LISTENING], transmit the value of the cell
    that you are requesting. (ex: AK). Put your flags back to [REST/LISTENING] when done, and wait for the other group to
    transmit back the value. Respond with [NUMERALS] for ‚ÄúI got it‚Äù</p>
    <p>Since the values are not standard semaphore symbols, use the ‚ÄúCell values semaphore table‚Äù to decode them.
    If you see the other team request [ATTENTION], watch for their request.</p>
    <p>Do you know what the ASCII art is? (ex: ‚ÄúDUCK‚Äù). Let them know! Signal [ATTENTION], then signal [NUMERALS] and spell out
    the word!</p>
    <p>Please let us know if you actually get to this step. ü§©</p>

This is not your exit; today, the salty ocean will not claim you as its own. Look up. Do not drown. Surf your way out.
Keep going through the loop; you will find somewhere worth …õ÷Ü∆à«ü÷Ñ…®’º…¢ to.
