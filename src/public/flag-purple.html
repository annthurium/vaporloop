  <h1>Semaphore</h1>
  <p>
    They say that there are ocean people, and mountain people. Extroverts love
    the open air, and introverts love protection of the earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    I disagree. Nobody can startle you on the water. You can be in company,
    and yet, entirely alone, signaling to others from miles away. The ocean is
    an indifferent sanctuary and a lonely kind of freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this station, you will use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore">Flag Semaphore</a>
    to communicate with the other team, which is located down the street from
    you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flag semaphore uses flags and body positions to communicate letters (and
    numbers). Flags and a physical copy of the Semaphore Alphabet are
    provided.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are three parts to this, from easiest to hardest. Proceed to the
    next one when you are ready.
  </p>

  <h1>Ƈǟʟɨɮʀǟȶɨռɢ</h1>

  <p>
    You will use the provided semaphore to transmit one of the following words
    to each other and wait for the other team to do the same.
  </p>
  <!-- i should have used flexbox for this but I'm running behind on time at this point -->
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>BIKE</td>
      <td>HILL</td>
      <td>MEOW</td>

  <p>Start your transmission with [ATTENTION].</p>
  <p>If you see the other side signal [ATTENTION], put down your flags in the position of [REST/LISTENING].</p>
  <p>When you are finished with your transmission, put down your flags in the position of [REST/LISTENING].</p>
  <p>If you think that the other side should try again, respond with [CANCEL] for “No idea!”.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, respond with [NUMERALS] for “I got it”, then perform a 15 second interpretive dance of the word that you
    have
    received.</p>
  <p>If the dance matches the word that you sent, respond with [NUMERALS] for “You got it”.</p>

  <h1>₵Ø₥₥Ʉ₦ł₵₳₮ł₦₲</h1>
  <p>After the first words have been exchanged, feel free to transmit any words of your choosing. Please keep words
    under 6
    letters or less.</p>
  <p>The other rules, including the interpretive dance, remain the same.</p>
  <p>If you would like, you can send the word “PUZZLE” to go on to the next section.</p>
  </p>If the other team sends the word “PUZZLE” and you do not want to do puzzles, respond with the word “NO” followed
  by
  [CANCEL] . Otherwise respond with [NUMERALS] for “You got it.”</p>
  <h1>ꀯꂦ꒒꒒ꁲꋰꂦꌅꁲꋖꂑꋊꁅ</h1>

  <p>If you both want, you can solve the following puzzles together.</p>
  <p>Start with the Puzzle labeled “1” then proceed to puzzle “2” and so on.</p>
  <p>Each puzzle is a picture of ASCII art, broken up into two pieces, pink and blue. One team has the “pink” sheet and
    the
    other team has the “blue” sheet.</p>
  <p>Some cells on each sheet have been intentionally left blank. The other team knows what is in those cells, but you
    have
    to ask.</p>
  <p>To request the value at a given cell, show [ATTENTION]. When you get a [REST/LISTENING], transmit the value of the
    cell
    that you are requesting. (ex: AK). Put your flags back to [REST/LISTENING] when done, and wait for the other group
    to
    transmit back the value. Respond with [NUMERALS] for “I got it”</p>
  <p>Since the values are not standard semaphore symbols, use the “Cell values semaphore table” to decode them.
    If you see the other team request [ATTENTION], watch for their request.</p>
  <p>Do you know what the ASCII art is? (ex: “DUCK”). Let them know! Signal [ATTENTION], then signal [NUMERALS] and
    spell out
    the word!</p>
  <p>Please let us know if you actually get to this step. 🤩</p>
