      The waves are out. It is sunrise and sunset, both at once. March never
      ended; March never began; Y2K lost in the frantic scheduling. Are we
      alone? All ȿtatue̠̅s juḑĝe ỹΘų hĂЯS̨̥̫͎̭ͯ̿̔̀ͅЋḼl̘̝̙̃ͤ͂̾̆ ȳɎ. Together we traverse the silence,
      like electrons and cyan.

      VAPORLOOP was an experimental event around connectivity in the real world
      during the pandemic. VAPORLOOP is over. Long live VAPORLOOP.

      We are not the only ones to produce interactive melancholy. On a certain
      level, the genre of vaporwave video games is understandable: everything is
      pastel, or soothing, or the right type of retro and nothing can go
      particularly, badly wrong.

      If you want to dig deep into history, you can try one of the first
      vaporwave games, Mall Quest. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to play
      it; we found a suspicious set of instructions on
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/43jdnf/mall_quest/"
        >Reddit.</a
      >

      All the games have soothing and awesome music. Video games are a way to
      spend a sunset, even when it is light outside.
