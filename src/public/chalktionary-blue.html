    <h1>Pictionary</h1>
    <p>
      The umpity-bajillion movies that show aliens attacking the earth got it
      all wrong. Where I'm from we have more colors than you would believe. We
      came, we saw, we got bored, we left.
    </p>

    <p>
      You see, weâ€™ve evolved beyond the need for text-based communication. The
      only reason Iâ€™m still here are emojis, which are humankind's last hope.
      Looking at ancient petroglyphs and hieroglyphs and glyph-glyphs, itâ€™s
      clear yâ€™all are heading right back where you started and I am HERE for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      To convince the rest of the EXTRATERRESTRIAL NEON DIMENSION to come party
      with us, we need your help to put more art into the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      In front of you, you will find some chalk, and also your phone. You will
      need them both.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you click the button, this page will display a phrase. You have some
      number of minutes to illustrate the concept on the ground in front of you,
      using chalk.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are done, or it has been more than 5-10 minutes, send a photo of
      your illustration to group chat.
      <b>Do not tell people what the phrase was. Ask them to guess.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Click the button again to generate the next phrase. Do not wait for the
      correct answer to your previous work before starting a new one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        Let other loopers know when their guess is correct on a factual, or an
        emotional level.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere, another team is doing exactly what you are doing right now.
      Support their efforts and try your best to let them know that you
      understand what their drawings are trying to say.
    </p>
    <button id="show-phrase">Let's go</button>
    <p>Your phrase is: <span class="extra" id="phrase"></span></p>

    <button id="toggle-visibility">
      At your next clock tick, tap this button.
    </button>
    <span id="hidden-content" class="hidden">

        You cannot bear to stay here, among the fake illusions of former
        memories. The earth will swallow your colors and strip them of meaning.
        Keep going through the loop; you will find somewhere worth É›Ö†ÆˆÇŸÖ„É¨Õ¼É¢ to.
      </p>

      <p><b>Your next location is X.</b></p>
