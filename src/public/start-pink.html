      If you feel like youâ€™ve been stuck in a time loop, for who knows how long,
      I know you know I know youâ€™re not alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Youâ€™re going to move through a series of stations. Each station is a
      chance to leave, but hardly a good one. One may suspect that if you exit
      before youâ€™ve completed all the experiences, you will be trapped forever;
      only at the end will the exit become apparent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like a hand, you will circle at the tick of the clock. These will
      correspond to real-world times, with roughly 30 real-world minutes at each
      station. We will send you a schedule in chat in advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Itâ€™s dangerous to go alone. Take a friend. Take some pixels. Take your
      glitchy geometric dreams. Take the world as it is, and as you wish it to
      be.
    </p>

    <p>Thatâ€™s a lot to hold in your heart at once. I believe in you.</p>

    <p>
      Your team is the PINK team. At each station, look for the QR code printed
      in your teamâ€™s color. Scan it to receive further instructions.
    </p>

    <button id="toggle-visibility">
      at the first clock tick, tap this button.
    </button>
    <span id="hidden-content" class="hidden">
      <p>
        As above, so below. Now, you're the best Program that's ever been
        written. That's the spirit. Now keep that skateboard rolling, and I'll
        try and cover you from this end.
      </p>

      <p>Your next location is X.</p>
