      The end is the beginning is the end. Vaporwave is dead, long live
      vaporwave.

    <p>
      You don’t have to leave at all. Escape is in your mind; the prison is in
      your heart.
    </p>

    <p>Restart yourself to accept the update. The only way out is through.</p>

    <p>Go to the center of the loop. Dance with us in eternity.</p>

    <p>
      The choice of your future belongs to you alone, but all of us hold this
      space together. When you eʂƈαρҽ the loop, carry its memories with you.
      Time can be whatever you want it to be.

    <p>Limerence is one hell of a drug.</p>

    <p class="extra">
      Go to Fort Meadow Park. I’ll be waiting for you at the tree with the rocks
      in it.
    </p>

    <p>The 🎶 dance party 🎶 was inside our hearts the entire time.</p>
